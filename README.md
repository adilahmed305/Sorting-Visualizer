# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting Algorithm Visualization in C++ using the SDL2 Library

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange the elements of a list in a specific order. Although numerous sorting algorithms exist, only a few are widely used in practical applications. In this project, we’ll visualize some common sorting algorithms to better understand how they work. The algorithms included are Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. We will use a fixed list size of 130 elements. You’ll have the ability to randomize the list and select a sorting algorithm from the available options. All of the algorithms will sort the list in ascending order. Note that the visualization speed doesn’t reflect the actual time complexity of each algorithm; faster algorithms like Merge Sort have been deliberately slowed down for better visualization.
